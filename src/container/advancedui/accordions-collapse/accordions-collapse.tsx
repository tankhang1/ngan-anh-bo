                  <Accordion.Body><strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden
                    by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we
                    use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as
                    well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with
                    custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that
                    just about  any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the
                    transition  does limit overflow.
